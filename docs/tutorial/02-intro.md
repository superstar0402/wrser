# Provenance Smart Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

CosmWasm provides the ability to create web assembly smart contracts - computations that take place
on a public blockchain - for the Cosmos SDK using the Rust programming language. Smart contracts are
the backend code for decentralized applications (dApps) - commonly paired with font end code
written in Javascript.

The `provwasm` library extends CosmWasm to allow developers to utilize custom functionality provided
by the Provenance Blockchain.
