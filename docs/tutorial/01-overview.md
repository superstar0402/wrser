# Provenance Smart Contract Tutorial

This tutorial will walk developers through a step-by-step process of creating and deploying a
web assembly smart contract to the Provenance Blockchain.

## Overview

This tutorial is broken out into two parts. The first will cover developing smart contracts.
The second will deal with deploying smart contracts to the Provenance Blockchain.

### Part 1: Development

- [Introduction](02-intro.md) - What is CosmWasm?
- [Getting Started](03-getting-started.md) - Set up a development environment.
- [Project](04-project.md) - Generate a smart contract project from template.
- [Requirements](05-requirements.md) - Define smart contract functionality.
- [Develop](06-develop.md) - Code, compile, and test the smart contract.
- [Optimize](07-optimize.md) - Create optimized contract Wasm for deployment.

### Part 2: Deployment

- [Setup](08-setup.md) - Start a provenance localnet cluster, create accounts and a marker.
- [Store](09-store.md) - Upload optimized contract Wasm.
- [Instantiate](10-instantiate.md) - Create an instance of the contract.
- [Query](11-query.md) - Get the smart contract configuration state.
- [Execute](12-execute.md) - Execute the contract, sending funds and collecting fees.
- [Migrate](13-migrate.md) - Notes on upgrading smart contracts.

### Up Next

Continue to the [Introduction](02-intro.md) for a high-level background of smart contracts.

To dive right in, proceed to the [Getting Started](03-getting-started.md) section.
