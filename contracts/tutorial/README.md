# Purchase Smart Contact
This is a simple smart contract that uses [provwasm](https://github.com/provenance-io/provwasm) to run on the [Provenance](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance) blockchain. When a user triggers this smart contract by sending it some coins it sends a certain percentage to a feebucket address and the remaining to the "merchant" address simulating a payment system.

This smart contract is also used in the provwasm integration tests in Provenance to verify basic smart contract support.
